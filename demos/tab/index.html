                Edinburgh Castle is one of the oldest fortified places in Europe. With a long rich history as a royal residence,
                military garrison, prison and fortress, it is alive with many exciting tales. When you climb Castle Hill, you will walk
                in the footsteps of soldiers, kings and queens – and even the odd pirate or two.
              </br></br>
              Though parts of it remain in military use, the castle is now a world-famous visitor attraction. It’s also an iconic part
              of the Old and New Towns of Edinburgh World Heritage Site.

                Set upon its mighty rock, Edinburgh Castle’s strategic advantage is clear. Seeing the site’s military potential, Iron
                Age people built a hill fort on the rock. Early medieval poetry tells of a war band that feasted here for a year before
                riding to their deaths in battle.
              </br></br>
                As well as guarding great moments in history, the castle has suffered many sieges. During the Wars of Independence it
                changed hands many times. In 1314, the Scots retook the castle from the English in a daring night raid led by Thomas
                Randolph, nephew of Robert the Bruce.
            </br></br>
                The castle defences have evolved over hundreds of years. Mons Meg, one of the greatest medieval cannons ever made, was
                given to King James II in 1457. The Half Moon Battery, built in the aftermath of the Lang Siege of 1573, was armed for
                200 years by bronze guns known as the Seven Sisters. Six more guns defend the Argyle Battery, with its open outlook to
                the north.
